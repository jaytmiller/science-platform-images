# NB-Curator Environment Specificiations

## Overview

This directory archives science platform image environment and
deployment specifications generated by the nb-curator project at
https://github.com/spacetelescope/nb-curator.  Think of these as
higher level mamba specs which may also include JupyterLab notebooks
and supporting data in addition to the usual package versions needed
to defined a mamba envionment.

## Nb-Curator

The nb-curator tool defines JupyterLab environments in a
notebook-centric way where the upstream curators of large archives of
notebooks strive to build environments to run critical notebooks which
are well documented and tested.  Consequently, in addition to the
usual support for compiling package versions and installing mamba
environments, the tool is designed to scrape and/or install notebooks
and their individual pip dependencies and package imports as well as
information about downloadable data which supports using or testing
included notebooks.  In addition,  the combined system of nb-curator
and science-platform-images is designed to support the automatic
builds of science platform notebook images on GitHub for download to
anyone anywhere.
