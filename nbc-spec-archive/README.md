### Overview of the Directory
- This directory stores environment and deployment specifications for science platforms.
- These specifications are generated by the nb-curator project, which can be found at https://github.com/spacetelescope/nb-curator.
- The specifications are considered higher-level mamba specs because they include not only package versions but also JupyterLab notebooks and supporting data.

### Nb-Curator Tool
1. **Definition**: The nb-curator tool is designed to define JupyterLab environments with a focus on notebooks.
2. **Functionality**:
   - It helps curators of large notebook archives build environments for critical, well-documented, and tested notebooks.
   - Beyond just handling package versions and mamba environment installations, it also scrapes and installs notebooks along with their specific pip dependencies and package imports.
   - Additionally, it gathers information about downloadable data needed for using or testing the included notebooks.

### Combined System of Nb-Curator and Science-Platform-Images
- **Purpose**: The system is designed to automatically build science platform notebook images on GitHub.
- **Accessibility**: These images are meant to be downloadable by anyone from anywhere, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in scientific computing environments.
