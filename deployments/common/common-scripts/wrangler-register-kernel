# for "classic builds" which are initialized using --inject-spi
# to define the requirements files, etc., based on a wrangler
# spec.
#
# This script registers the wrangler environment defined for this
# image by the spec in the deployment's environments directory as
# a Jupyter kernel at startup to make sure there is a GUI menu
# item to select it.  Don't call this for non-wrangler kernels.
